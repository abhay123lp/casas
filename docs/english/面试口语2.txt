应聘律师助理
=============================================================================
I:  Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background.
A:  I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field. My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts. My major in college was English, and as a result, my writing skills are my major strength. I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used.
I:  What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession?
A:  Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input.
I:  Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description?
A:  There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week. Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks, my boss and I stayed until 2 a.m. for two nights before the final wrap up. It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results. My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort.
I:  Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome.
A:  I remember a case that was filled with obstacles. The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances. I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step. I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch. Through some hard work and fact digging, I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles. I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations, which she and I discussed and eventually resolved. My boss was impressed with the work I had done.
I:  What are your strengths and weaknesses?
A:  My strengths are my caring about getting the job done. I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs. As far as weaknesses, I really enjoy my work, and sometimes I put in too much time. But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more.
I:  Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss.
A:  I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves. I asked her if I could talk with her one day, and we had a good discussion. It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure. I took the time to explain the procedures, and there haven't been any problems since that day.
I:  When do you find a job satisfying?
A:  My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job. When I first started as a paralegal, I had a lot to learn. But through hard work, advice from some good mentors and continuing education, I have come a long way. I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner.
I:  How would your coworkers describe you?
A:  First, they'd say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. I really enjoy working with people. Secondly, they'd say I had great customer service skills. I put the customer first. And thirdly, they'd say that I know the law. I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously.
I:  Do you have any questions?
A:  Yes, I do. On a scale of one to 10, what would you say morale was in this company?

Dialogue 1
I:  It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature.
A:  Right. Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background.
I:  Yes.
A:  But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people. So I took an evening course at the  Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate.
I:  So you must be an extravert?
A:  Yes, I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them.
I:  What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide?
A:  A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities, and offering service of transportation, accommodation, sightseeing, shopping and entertainment.

I:  Have you any experience as a tourist guide?
A:  Yes, I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University.
I:  Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English?

A:  Yes, I know. A friend of mine is a guide. He talked with me about his work, but I don't  mind working hard.
I:  Have you applied with any other companies?
A:  No, this is my first.
I:  Is there anything you want to ask about?
A:  I'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday. Would there ever be any chance of that?
I:  Certainly. There'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company. Not right away, of course, but in a few years, after you learn more about our business, you may go overseas with a tour group. Any questions?
A:  Yes. When can I get the decision? I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible. If I'm turned down, I  ll have to secure a position elsewhere.

A:  Thank you. Good-bye.
I:  Good-bye.
