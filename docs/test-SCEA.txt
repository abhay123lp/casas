Question 1

    Happy Joe Banking Corporation is building a Banking application to provide online access to their account holders. They have chosen 2 SUN 450s for their web server cluster and 1 SUN E10000 for their application server. The business requirements indicate that to become a customer, a person must have at least a primary checking account with the bank. Further since the customer will be using the Internet to view confidential information, security is considered paramount. What do you understand about the requirements of the system?
    
    a) The need for Security is a classic example of a functional service level requirement and the checking account rule, an example of non-functional QoS requirement. 	
    b) The discussion about Security and the mandatory checking account both illustrate functional service level requirements.
    c) Neither Security nor the mandatory Checking Account is examples of any kind of requirements, theoretically speaking. 	
    d) Security is an Architectural non-functional requirement and the Mandatory Checking Account a functional design requirement.
    e) They are both examples of Business Use Cases. 	 

Question 2

Which of the following are not true about N-Tier Systems?

   1. N-Tier systems are distributed over many systems and hence always present a maintenance problem.
   2. N-Tier systems are generally component based and are therefore quite easy to maintain.
   3. Since N-Tier systems do not use database stored procedures or triggers for business logic processing, they are generally very slow.
   4. Since N-Tier systems are container based, many N-Tier systems can be easily scaled (both vertically and horizontally).
   5. N-Tier systems suffer only from one drawback over client/server systems - N-Tier systems do not take advantage of resource sharing techniques like connection pooling.
   6. N-Tier systems can use various techniques for Identification, Authentication and Authorization and are therefore considered quite secure.

a) 1 & 2 	b) 2,5, & 6
c) 1, 2, & 5 	d) 3 & 6
e) 1, 3, & 5 	f) 1 & 5


Question 3

    Nopester Inc., a CD manufacturer uses Metallic Corporation for making jewel cases. When the inventory of jewel cases falls under the reorder level, Nopester communicates with Metallic via faxes. Nopester now wants to build a solution for its supply chain management. Metallic uses a legacy system that supports CORBA interfaces for other companies to interface to them with. Metallic's servers are protected by firewalls and will only let HTTP or HTTPS requests through. What is Nopester's best option here?
    a) Since Metallic will not let CORBA requests through, Nopester should continue sending faxes. 	
    b) Nopester should take its business away to Metallic's competitors.
    c) Nopester should use the popular SOAP protocol since SOAP requests communicate over HTTP. 	
    d) Nopester should use a concept called HTTP tunneling to communicate with Metallic.

    d) Write a Java front end then use CORBA to communicate with the mainframe.
    e) Use the Java Native Interface (JNI) to communicate with the mainframe. 	
    f) Use object mapping.
    g) Use JMS.    

Question 17

    Your 3-tier application has been running smoothly in a production environment for over 3 months. Due to a recent television campaign, you have started to experience three times the volume of normal traffic. Your architect has suggested that a round robin load distribution mechanism be employed to cope with the issue. How is DNS round robin going to be helpful in this situation?
    a) Splitting requests evenly amongst all back end servers. 	
    b) The proxy sits behind the backend servers monitoring the performance of each one. When it notices one is being used too much it will automatically forward requests to a different server.
    c) Time each server has available. 	
    d) A technique used to target certain requests to certain backend servers, e.g. All Servlet requests from one server and all static HTML from another.

Question 18

    A Fortune 500 company wishes to add new functionality to their existing sales system and has contracted you as the lead architect for the project. The legacy system has been written in C++. They wish to keep this system running and may switch over to a full Java solution later, depending on the performance of the new functionality. So how will connect to this legacy system?
    a) Wrap the application using JNI and make it accessible using RMI. 	
    b) Rewrite the C++ code in Java. This shouldn't be too hard because it's converting from one object-orientated language to another.
    c) Use a screen scraper. 	
    d) Use CORBA to talk to the C program then get the CORBA to talk to the RMI server.


Question 19
