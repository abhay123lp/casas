Distributed EIS Adapters
  Legacy Connectivity Using JEE Connector Architecture

Resource Adapter
  Deployable JCA components are called resource adapters.

System Contract
  An application server and an EIS collaborate to keep all system-level mechanisms, such as transactions, security, and connection management, transparent to the application components  
  
  Connection management contracts
    provide for pool connections to an underlying EIS and let application components connect to an EIS. This leads to a scalable application environment that can support a large number of clients.
  
  Transaction management contract
  A transaction management contract lets an application server use a transaction manager to manage transactions across multiple resource managers. 
  The contract also supports transactions that are managed internal to an EIS resource manager without the necessity of involving an external transaction manager.
  The service enables the transaction manager of Application Server to manage transactions across multiple back-end systems.

  Security contract
    A security contract enables a secure access to an EIS and provides support for a secure application environment,  

In JEE 1.4, JCA1.5 introduced additional contracts:

  Life Cycle Management Contract 
    The application server manages the startup and shutdown of the resource adapter.
  
  Work Management Contract 
    Allows the resource adapter to do work by submitting it to an application server for execution. 
    Since the application server does the work for the resource adapter, the resource adapter needn¡¯t worry about thread management. Instead, the application server manages this aspect efficiently and can use thread pooling if necessary.
  
  Transaction Inflow Contract 
    This allows a resource adapter to propagate an imported transaction to an application server, as well as flow-in transaction completion and failure recovery initiated by an EIS.
  
  Message Inflow Contract 
    This allows the resource adapter to synchronously or asynchronously deliver messages to end points in the application server, irrespective of message style, semantics, and infrastructure. 
    In this way, different message providers, such as JMS and JAXM, can be plugged into J2EE application servers. 
    This contract allows the EIS to be an active process, generating its own events and messages rather than a passive data source

Java Connector Architecture
  Basic EAI features:
    Resource adapters
      Typical EAI vendors include proprietary adapters which allow for synchronous and asynchronous communication to an EIS.

    Data mapping
      Data acquired in one format by the resource adapter may have to be transformed into the format required for the business object
      
    Messaging brokers
      Enable both point-to-point (PTP) and publish/subscribe messaging
