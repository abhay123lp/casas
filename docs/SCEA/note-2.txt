Elements Used in UML
Relationships Used in UML
    Generalization
    	A specialized version of another class 
    	Solid line with a closed arrowhead pointing to the more general class
    Association 
    	Uses the services of another class
    	Solid line connecting the associated classes,with an optional open arrowhead showing direction of navigation
	Aggregation 
		A class ¡°owns¡± another class 
		A form of association with an unfilled diamond at the ¡°owner¡± end of the association
	Composition 
		A class is composed of another class;refers to an aggregation within which the component parts and the larger encompassing whole share a lifetime
		A form of aggregation, shown with either a filled diamond at the ¡°composite¡± end, or with the composite graphically containing the ¡°component¡±
	Refinement 
		A refined version of another class;refinement within a given model can be shown as a dependency with the stereotype <<refines>> or one of its more specific forms, such as <<implements>>
		Dashed line with a closed hollow arrowhead pointing to the more refined class
	Dependency 
		A class dependent on another class 
		Dashed line with an open arrowhead pointing to the dependency

Diagrams Used in UML
   activity diagram vs state diagram
   sequence diagram vs collaboration diagram

Practical Use of UML Diagrams
	Use Case Diagram
	The use case lends itself to a problem-centric approach to analysis and design.
	Use cases are the functions or services of the system¡ªthose that are visible to its actors.
	Use case diagrams are closely connected to scenarios. A scenario is an example of what happens when someone interacts with the system. 
	For example, here is a scenario for a security trade: a trader accesses an Internet-based system and chooses the type of security he or she wants to place a trade order to buy or sell
