　　What do you think , Edward?

　　I think the design is very good but not for this product.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I agree. I am sorry , Phill. But it seems rather young for our market.

　　Edward Green:
　　Derek, who's idea with this? Did you think of this one?

　　Phil Waston:
　　How do you market research for a market?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Good question. It depends on the product. We have around the research people in house so we do very detailed salsments. But of cource we buy in market research expect item when we look out side of the U.K. Marketing Big Boss is very completecatied and targeting both adult and children.

　　Ms Wong:
　　No, thanks, I'm fine.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Please, have a seat.
　　Well, Sally, you've seen the company. You've seen our products. What do you think?
　　
　　Mr. Wong:
　　You have a wide product range, but they're all dependent on the same chip nology. I think we maybe supply you with some of necessary secritry. But of course we need to speak further about this.

　　Well, thinks for coming in.
　　
　　Ms. Wong:
　　It is being most interesting.
　　
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　This is the latest prototype.
　　
　　Phill Watson:
　　How does it work?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Say somthing to the Boss.
　　
　　Phil watson:
　　Like what?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Anything. There is a microphoe in Boss's eyes, and it recognise certain command.It records what you say and stores it. When it hears the trigger word , it play it back.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　I am sorry. Could you repeat that? I don't understand what you mean by trigger word.
　　
　　Dereck Jones:
　　Ok, I'll try to explain it more simplely. We can program the Boss to say something like 'I don't want problems, I want sulations. And we do this like this: you press his nose and that activates the voice card. Then you say phrase.
　　"I don't want problems, I want solutions". Then you press the noise again.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　Why do you do that?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　You do that in order to stop the recording. Then you select you trigger word. 
　　
　　Phil watson:
　　What is that?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　The trigger word makes the Boss speak. Everytime he hears that word, he will say "I don't want problems, I want solutions."
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　So let me carifine this. Each time the Boss hears the trigger word he will repeat the phrases.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Exactly. So give hime the trigger.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　Okay, Ummm.... The trigger can be the word :problems.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Fine. Say it to his ear, then.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　Problem.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Okay, now say a sentence with the word 'problem' in it.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　Excuse me, Big Boss. I am having some some problems with the project.
　　
　　Big Boss:
　　Problems, I don't want problems. I want solutions.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　Brilight! How is it powered?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Aha! You'll enjoy this: light energy. It won't need new batteries. Both the eyes contain photo-sensitive cells which absorb the solar engery. These cells then power the motor located it here under each arm. Now, as everybody knows, when you have this kind of configuration there is a...
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Sorry, Derek. Would you mind explaining that in another way?

　　Unit9 Part2 Explaining how something works (dictation and check)
　　
　　Ms Wong:
　　Tell me, do these toys work?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　These? Yes.
　　
　　Ms Wong:
　　How old are they?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Some of them are Victorian. No microchips in these. All clockwork. Some of them are quite ingenious. Look at this one for instance. A young violin player.
　　
　　Mr Wong:
　　It's very beautiful. How does it work?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　And you just run it up. And of goes. My grandmother played with some of these when she was a girl. And my father collected clockwork toys.
　　
　　Mr Wong:
　　They are very clever.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　But not very safe. Look at the sharp edges on this one. Very dangerous. And it covered with lead paint
　　
　　Ms Wong:
　　Tell me how does this work?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Arha.
　　
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　I've pressed return and nothing happens. I'v try that. How can I get out the programme. Just second. Could you speak more slowly, please? Right. Let me try.F1, then return. Yes, then press the escape. That's it. Thanks.
　　
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Let me show you how products are market researched. You see all products go through the same, basic process. They start as an idea. Every months a Management Committee looks at all the ideas. And they put the development money into some of them. Let me show you an example. Take this product. Friendly Fish. The idea came from a freelance designer. A Management Committee looked at the designs and they liked them. Follow me.
　　They asked the development team how much it would cost to manufacture the product. And they asked the Marketing Department two questions:
　　1. Who is the target market for Friendly Fish.
　　2. How big is the market?
　　We then know if the idea is worthy taking onto the next stage, which is the feasibility study.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　So what happened with the Friendly Fish?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　We learned at this stage that it was a low cost high volume mass market product. The feasibility study indicated that Friendly Fish would sell all over Europe. We the invested in more market research. We ask a large group of 8 years old from different backgrounds about Friendly Fish. We asked them questions like which material shall we use? Which colours do you like? etc. A few of the kids wanted it green and blue. 17.5% other children wanted it red.
　　But all of them wanted Friendly Fish. All of them. They love Friendly Fish. We checked each key indicator. Every one of them was positive. We made half a million.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　And what are sales like?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Terrible. Sometimes it happens. Even with all the market research, you can never be 100% certain.
　　Unit 10 Rescheduling plans and arrangements Part1
　　
　　Smith:
　　Edward, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'll have to cancel our meeting tomorrow.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　That's no problem. Shall we postpone it until later in the week?
　　
　　Mr. Simth:
　　No, I am afraid I am not postponing our meeting. I am canceling it.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　We need to sign the contract and complete the deal, don't we? Is there a problem?
　　
　　Mr. Smith:
　　No, not for me. But perhaps there's a problem for you. I am afraid Big Boss wouldn't be in the catalogue.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Are we too late for the printer's deadline?
　　
　　Mr.Smith:
　　No. That's not the point. I'm not going to use Big Boss. I am going to use another product.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I don't understand.
　　
　　Mr. Smith:
　　Well, listen. Then you will understand. It's a new product from J.K Toys. It's called Dealer Dan.

　　Edward:
　　Yes.
　　
　　Mr. Smith:

　　You say he's called Dealer Dan.
　　
　　Mr. Smith:
　　Yes. He arrived yesterday afternoon. The Head of Marketing form J.K Toys introduced us. They'll launch him on January 20th.

　　What! Is Dealer Dan solar powered?
　　
　　Mr. Smith:
　　Yes.
　　
　　Edward:
　　And voice-activated?
　　
　　Mr. Smith:
　　Yes. It's the same technology... But cheaper. I think Dealer Dan would just like to say bye-bye.
　　
　　Dealer Dan: Bye-bye.
　　
　　Mr. Smith:
　　I don't understand...
　　
　　Dealer Dan:
　　If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
　　
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　I'm afraid Mr. Peter is running a bit behind schedule. But he won't be long. 
　　
　　Anonymouse:
　　Thank you.
　　
　　Edward:
　　Have you seen Don?
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　He's in the boardroom in a meeting.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Something important has come up. I need to talk to him.
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　He's with Mr. Reiley. Go on.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　We'll get some example of display materials to you and there will also be a point of sale video of the product.Come in.
　　
　　Edward:
　　Don, Mr. Reiley. Sorry to interrupt. Something important has come up. Can you spare a minute?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Can it wait? I'll be through in ten minutes.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Not really.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Okay. I'm sorry. Do you mind if I deal with this?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I think we've got problem. I have just talked to Mr. Smith on the phone. The catalogue deal is off. J.K. Toys are launching Dealer Dan.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Who the hell is Dealer Dan?
　　Unit 10 Rescheduling plans and arrangements Part2
　　
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Let's get this straight. You think we'll meet these targets.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Yes, I do. But we'll need to either increase overtime or take on some causal staff.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Do you mind if I butt in?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Not at all. What's the matter?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I think we need to talk. Something very important has come up.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Do you know where Don is? I through he was in a meeting with a client.
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　He was. But he cut the meeting short. There's a problem.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　What?
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　I don't know. Something about Dealer Dan.
　　
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Everything in Big Boss is new. The idea is new. The technology is new.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Maybe Dealer Dan is a coincidence. Is that possible?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Of course it's possible, but it is very unlikely.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　How many people knew about the Boss?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Well, hundreds of people.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　No, I'm sorry, that's not what I mean. I am talking about the technology. How many knew about that?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Well, only the people in my team.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I think we need to find more about Dealer Dan.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　I will make a few calls. Don, you set up a meeting with the marketing team and look at our options. I will get back to you as soon as I hear anything. Derek, I want you to get hold of Dealer Dan.
　　
　　
　　Denny Ross:
　　I'm calling about the meeting scheduled for this afternoon. I'm terribly sorry but Don won't be able to make it. Is there any chance that we could re-arrange it for the same time next week?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Yes, I am really sorry, but it's absolutely impossible for me this afternoon. I'll have to work late tonigh. Something is come up.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Is there any way that Mrs. Clark could bring forward her meeting with Don by an hour? I'm try to re-schedule all of Don's appointments for tomorrow.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Ah, do you have his diary in front of you? Good. Could we move the meeting from two o'clock on Thursday to sometime on Friday morning?
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Alright, if you can't make any time in the next week, could we set up a four-way telephone conference.
　　
　　
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　Clive, it's Mr. Sakai on the line for you.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Mr. Sakai? How are you, Kazo?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Well, Clive, thank you. 
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　It's nice to hear from you. How are the family?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　They are fine, Clive. Thank you for asking. Clive, can I come to the point very quickly?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Please do.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　I'm very worried. I have just seen a new product which is very like the Big Boss.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Really?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　I have changed my plans. I'll in London tomorrow. We must meet. My secretary will fax all my travel plans.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Yes, of course, Kazo. I'll meet you at the airport. Goodbye.
　　Sally, what ever you have arranged for me tomorrow ,It's canceled. I will be at the airport all morning with Mr. Sakai. And possibly the afternoon as well.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　How much do J.K. Toys know about you and who told them? And how good is Dealer Dan?
　　
　　The end of Unit 10

Unit 11 Analysing your competitors Part1
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　The technology is the same as ours.I have never seen two products which are so similar. In concept and design, there are no basic differences. None.However, I have examined the components and the XR590
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　What is the XR580?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　The XR590 is the power source which drivers Dealer Dan. I think it has a few weeknesses.Is not as good. In my opinion, it's not reliable enough for children.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Exactly how unreliable is it?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I cann't say exactly. I haven't complete the tests yet. It's too early to say.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Will it affect their sales?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Derek.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Not much in the first six months, I suppose.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Its the first six months are very important.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Edward, what do you think of their packaging?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Well, plenty of bright colours. It'll have a lot of impact at point of sale.
　　
　　
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　I am afraid they are all meeting at the moment. No, I'm sorry I don't know what time it will finish. I'll put you through to Mr Harris's secretary, and she can make an appointment for you. Please hold the line.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Nice to see you again, Peter. It's been a long time
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　How are things at Bibury Systems?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Very interesting at the moment
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　I've just heard you're going to partnership with a rather good Japanese company.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　That's not exactly true... Peter, are you still doing consultancy work?
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　Yes. I haven't retired yet!
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Look, can I give you a lift back? We haven't had a chance to chat for a long time.
　　
　　
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　What have you found out about their marketing strategy?
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　They have already scheduled a television advertising campaign.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Who with?
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　E.G.N.C. The company that they always use
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　When is it scheduled?
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Sometime next month, but I haven't found out the exact date yet.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Have you heard what they are spending on TV advertising?
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　I don't know.


Unit 11 Analysing your competitors Part 2
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　No, I'm sorry,they are still in a meeting. I don't know how long they'll be. Let me take your number and I will get one of them to call you back.
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　It's good of you to give me a lift.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　It's no problem. Are you still doing concultancy work for J.K. Toys?
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　I wondered why you were going out of way to give me a lift.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Well, are you?
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　Technically no. I've just finished. But that work was confidential.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Yes, of course. You could be working for us, you know, I might need a consulant.
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　Really?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Well, perhaps. I might need an idea of the best way to react to Dealer Dan.
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　How did you get to hear about that?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　A customer. Do you know that Dealer Dan is very like a new toy we have developed? Dealer Dan could hurt us badly. I don't want any secrets. I don't want to compromise you, I just want some general information.
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　How general?
　　
　　
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　We know their selling price, but what's their unit cost?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Derek, what's you estimate?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I can't say. I don't know what their production run is. We haven't had that information yet.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Well, Big Boss's production run is 300 thousand. Will they produce three hundred thousand? Or more?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I don't know that answer to that one. At that retail price they have to sell a lot of toys.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　It can't be less than 300 thousand, can it?
　　
　　
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　Thanks for the lift, Clive.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　You are something of a specialist in the Far East, aren't you?
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　You could say that.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Well, when this deal with this Japanese is settled, we might need you help. We should need a consultant to help set things up. Of course, the success of Big Boss is a very important part of the deal.
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　When might this happen?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　That depends.
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　The production run is 300 thousand units.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　And the advertising budget?
　　
　　Peter Day:
　　Clive, I don't know. Really, I don't know.
　　
　　--------the End of Unit 11
 
Unit12 Part1 Business letters and presenting information
　　
　　Don Braadley:
　　We haven't decided on the plan of action yet. We must outline a strategy, but first let me summary what we're said so far. This is a critical situation. We know J.K. Toys are playing to win. And we know that right now they have the edge. So, let's look at the down side. What are their advantages? They have a large market share; They have a cheeper product; They have an earlier launch date, and we think they have a large advertising budget.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Their strategy is very clear: they want our share of the market, both the European market and the export market.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　We cannot let them succeed. We have to consider which of these factors we can influence. Kate, any ideas?
　　
　　Kate mckenna:
　　There are two immediate things we can do:
　　We can increase our advertising budget and bring forward the launch date.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Derek, is that feasible?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I don't think so.
　　
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　I've got some news for you all.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Okay, just a second. I'll switch on the speaker. Okay, Clive, go ahead.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　I've got some useful information from Peter Day:
　　First of all, they are moving too fast. They haven't down their sums.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Clive, this is Derek. Do you know how large the production run's going to be?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　It's going to be around 300 thousand units.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　That's about what we hoped--more 450 thousand and we've got problems.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　This is Kate. I've got a question.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Go ahead, Kate.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Were you able to find out anything about their overseas marketing strategy?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Well, I'll tell you this Kate:
　　They won't crack the American market --we're a few steps ahead of them there and I want you to exploit that advantage -- you need to get out there fast. Look I'll ring off now. I 'll get back to the office as soon as I can.

Unit 12 part2 
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　The most important thing now is to let all of the sales force know about this change in our game plan. Jenny we need to write them at once. We need to give them some of the background to this ---about what J.K. Toys are planning, and about our new market strategy--that's 1. the launch date 2. the price cut And 3. the increased advertising buddget. 
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　We need to make it clear that "Big Boss" is absolute priority.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Jenny, could make a draft of that and we get it out as soon as possible.
　　Edward, you 've been very quite ---what else can we do in market?
　　
　　Edward:
　　We must get into Mr. Simith's catalogue. He's chosen Dealer Dan, and he's decided not to include "Big Boss". 
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　I don't think he'll change his mind now.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　I'll deal with Mr. Smith-- I'll write to him straight after the meeting and let you have a copy.
　　Jenny, I'd like to dictate a letter which need to be faxed as soon as possible to Mr. Smith.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Right, I'm ready.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Dear Mr. Sith, I have learned that you have decided to select Dealer Dan for your catalogue, instand of "Big Boss". I understand that your reasons for rejecting "Big Boss" are as follows:
　　1. That the unit cost will be 30% higher than the rival product.
　　2. That the launch date of Big Boss will be three weeks late.
　　3. That J.K. Toys, the manufacturer, will mount an extensive advertising campaign to coincide with the launch date of the product and the mailing date of your catalogue.
　　I would like you to reconside your decision in the light of the following:
　　1. Bibury Systems have rescheduled the launch date of Big Boss to January 15th, one week before the planned launch of Dealer Dan.
　　2. Because of the market profile of your catalogue, we have decided to offer you an extra 2.5% commission on sales through the catalogue in exchange for exclusivity.
　　3. In addition, Bibury Systems are prepared to offer your customers a discount of 15% on the recommended retail price.
　　I am sure that this new information will encourage you to econsider your decision and inclued "Big Boss" in your Spring Edition.
　　I look forward to receiving your thoughts on this matter.
　　Your sincerely, Clive Harris MD Bibury Systems.
　　
　　
　　----The end of Unit 12

Unit 13 Part 1 Travelling on Business
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　We have direct competition from J.K. Toys. We have to make sure that the sales and marketing campaign for "Big Boss" is the best we have ever done. So we are going to have to make a extra effact. We have brough the launch date forward to January 15th. It will be very tight, but I am sure that we can make this deadline. Do you agree? So let's just outline what we going to do. Kate, I think you should get the sales people in the States as soon as possible.
　　
　　Kate Macknna:
　　Ok, I will be on the frist available flight.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　You also make sure that they understand how important this "Big Boss" project is. 
　　
　　Kate Macknna:
　　should I talk to our UK agents as well?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　No, I think you ought to leave that to Don.
　　
　　Kate Macknna:
　　Okay.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Derek, I think you should visit the component suppliers that Don saw last week. Confirm that they can meet these new deadlines. It's essential that they deliver on time,on spec and on price.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Okey.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Don, what are your plans?
　　
　　Don :
　　I have arranged to go to see some of our overseas franchise holders next week.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　What countries are you going to?
　　
　　Don:
　　I am going to Italy, Egypt and Germany. 
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　I don't think you should go, Don. I think you ought to stay at head office. It is essential that you co-ordinate the new launch strategy.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Okay, I don't want to cancel those meetings. could I send Edward?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Do you think he's ready for that?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Edward is very capable. And I think a little international business travel will broaden his horizons.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Yes, certainly. Send Edward, but you ought to brief him very carefully.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Sure.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Good, I will talk to the bank. I will try to re-schedule the loan. It wouldn't be easy. 
　　
　　
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Geraldine, have you seen Edward?
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　He was here a second ago.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Thanks.

　　Hotel Receptionist:
　　Yes, Mr. Mckenna, there is a fax here and a telephone message.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Thank you. Oh, and I wonder if you could help me. A colleague of mine want to meet me at this restaurant. Could you tell me the best way of getting there?
　　
　　Hotel Receptionist:
　　Well, it's a five minute walk or you can get a cab. Would you like us to call a cab for you?
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　That's very kind of you, but I would like to walk. Could you tell me where I am on this map?
　　
　　Hotel Receptionist:
　　Right. We are here. The restaurant is there. So you take a right out the hotel, here, and it's a couple of blocks down. The entrance is just off the side-walk.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna
　　Thank you.
　　
　　
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Edward, did you have a good journey?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Excellent. I brought you back a little souvenir.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Edward! Thank you and how was your meeting with Mr. Lang in 
　　Frankfurt?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Very successful, I think.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Did you go for a meal?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　A very good meal. We had....
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　And who paid for it?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I did. Or rather Bibury System did.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　How did you manage that?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Just before the bill came, I asked to be excused and then I paid the waiter.
　　
　　
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　I'd like to check out, please.
　　
　　Hotel Receptionist:
　　Certainly mandam. Have you taken anything from Minibar this morning?
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　No, there are two bags in my room.
　　
　　Hotel Receptionist:
　　I'll just call the bell captain. Here is your final account. Is something wrong?
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　No, I am just not certain what this item refers to.
　　
　　Hotel Receptionist:
　　Ah... let me check... That's a deposit against the use of the conference facilities on Thursday.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Oh, I see. Could I have a separate receipt for that please?
　　
　　Hotel Receptionist:
　　Of course, madam. I'll just print one out for you.
　　
　　Kate Makenna:
　　And can I just double check that I'm booked in here for two nights, starting Wednesday.
　　
　　Hotel Receptionist:
　　That's right Ms. Mckenna. We look forward to seeing you again on Wednesday evening.

Unit 14 Presenting a New Product
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming this afternoon. In the next hour or so I'm going to introduce you to a completely new concept in toy manufacture.
　　I should begin by talking about the market research which lead to the development of this product.
　　Then I shall explain the technical developments, the productiong and our marketing strategy.
　　finally I shall outline our recommendations as to how you can make this product as a success in your territory.
　　By the end of the hour you will be able to see why Bibury Systems are so committed to this new venture and why we are so confident that we can capture the Amercian market.
　　So let's begin with the background....
　　
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Can I speak to Phil Watson please? This is Jenny from Bibury Systems.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　Hello, Phil Watson.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Phil, this is Jenny from the Marketing Department of Bibury Systems.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　Hi, Jenny. How's life?
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Complicated. I've been leaving urgent message for you for the last few days, but obviously haven't seen them. 
　　I'm afraid it looks like our competitors, J.K. Toys, have got something that is very similar to Big Boss.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　Oh no. How similar?
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　It's bad new. J.K. Toys are launching their product in six weeks time, so we have decided to bring forward our launch date again. Can you bing over your designs so Don can see them?
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　They're not finished yet, but I'll bring everything I have...
　　
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　So to sum up, everything indicated that the market was ready for a hi-tech product, a product that would appeal to both parents and children, a product that lets the user decide the character of the toy.
　　Ladies and gentlemen let me introduce a break-through in toy technology.
　　Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Big Boss.
　　
　　Big Boss:
　　My name is Big Boss.
　　In six months's time everyone here in the United States of Amercia will be talking about Big Boss.
　　And you, my friends, can take a share in my incredible success.
　　
　　
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Derek, I got 15 minutes. That's all. I have a meeting with your accountant.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I would like you to take a look. It won't take long.
　　It's a development of Big Boss.
　　It's Big boss Mark 2. 
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　It's look a bit like Big Boss.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　But it has emotions. It can cry, it can laugh, not just make the noise. Every doll of market can do that.
　　No, Mark 2 can actually make the movements and the gestures. It's programed to look happy, sad, angry or tired at the touch of a button, or even by voice control.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Derek, I can see you do a lot of work on these. It does look ingenious. How long has it take you?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Months. I think it's a really breakthrough.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　How difficult will it be to manufacture?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　We have new materials here. Have you seen the new treated plastics? They are very flexible. They are much more adaptable than the Big Boss material. And we have the technology. Take a look at this basic designs. I will show you what I mean. 
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　It will cost fortune to develop. It'll cost 3 times as much as Big Boss.
　　 
　　Derek Jones:
　　Not that much. It is an expensive product, but Big Boss is selling upmarket.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Let's see what Don and Kate say, but I think it will cost too much.
　　
　　
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　To conclude the presentation we have seen that Big Boss can succeed in the American market. We have product that can give the user more than anything else on the market. There is nothing that can touch it. 
　　Our competitors cannot deliver the technology. They cannot match our price and they cann't compete with our television campaign. Big Boss is going to be coast to coast at peak hours every day in the new year. And how much are we spending on this campaign? 
　　Well, let's have a look at the individual territories.
　　
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　This is the wording, which I agreed with Edward.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Fine, it's very clare, and I think it's colours work very well.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　We'll have three different photographs of the boss on the display.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Yes, I like this two still but I'm not sure about that one.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　There are plenty of options. Have a look at these contact sheets. 
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　How soon will this be camera-ready?
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　By next Tuesday.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I really need this for tomorrow.
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　Tomorrow? That's difficult.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　How difficult?
　　
　　Phil Watson:
　　It will be ready for tomorrow.
　　
　　
　　The End of Unit 14

Unit 15 Entertaining Visitors
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.
　　But I would just like to say a few more words. I promise to keep it brief.
　　I know that one or two of you have to leave now, but for those who can stay, it's time to relax. 
　　We have prepared some refreshments so that you can talk informally about how we can work together to make big boss a sucess. 
　　The tables that's over there has plenty of food on it! And I hope to be able to speak to all of you before you leave. And once again, think you very much for coming.
　　
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Don, what are your plans for this weekend?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Nothing special. Why?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Sakai is back in London for a week before flying home. He still hasn't decided which company he wants to deal with. He is interested in Dealer Dan. We will have to work hard. We have to close this deal.
　　He maybe free this weekend and a friend of Sakai's told me he's a keen golfer. Would you be able to offer him a game?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Yes, I could call him at his hotel.
　　
　　
　　
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Yes, we know how important the American market is.
　　In fact our chief executive appointed an American as director of Marketing and Sales.
　　Well, you know Don Bradley.... he's born and bred in Los Angles.
　　
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Ah, Mr. Sakai, this is Don Bradley from Bibury Systems.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Oh, yes, hello Don.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　How's your trip going?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Very well, thank you. Hard work, but very useful.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I hear you play golf?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　That's right. I do.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I'm a member of a very good club that's not far from your hotel. Would you care for a round tomorrow?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Thank you very much. I have just arranged to visit some tourist sites tomorrow.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Then how about on Sunday?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Yes, that's fine.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Can I offer you a lift?
　　I will come to colect you at your hotel at 10:30.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　That's very nice of you.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Let's meet in the hotel lobby.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Fine.
　　
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Would you excuse me? I must just have a quick work with George before he goes.
　　George, thank you very much for coming. I hope you think it was worth it.
　　
　　George:
　　Kate, it has been a great presentation and a great evening.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Well, please stay in touch and let me how how the campaign goes.
　　
　　
　　Sakai:
　　How often do you manage to play glof.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I like to play twice a week. But neither Clive or I have been able to play for the last three week because we have been too busy.
　　
　　Mr Sakai:
　　If I could just touch on bussiness for a second...
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Please do.
　　
　　Mr Sakai:
　　let me be open. A rival of bibury System is not only marketing a similar product but is also launching it around the same time.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Have you seen the rival product?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Yes, I have seen Dealer Dan.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　which product would you prefer?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Personally I like the Boss better.
　　
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Why did you come to the UK?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　My wife is English. We live in America for a while, but she prefers to living near her family.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　How did you meet your wife?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　After university I came to Europe to have a short holiday. At least that was the plan. Within six months I was both married and working for Bibury Systems. And I'm still here.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　You must like living in the UK, then?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　At first I thought I would never get used to the weather, but there are lots of good things. I love the countryside and I really enjoy going to the theatre.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Ah, you like the theatre.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I like the theatre.
　　
　　Mr Sakai:
　　I love the theatre.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　I was planning to go to the theatre to see 'Welfth Night'. Do you have any plans for tomorrow evening?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　No, not really.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　If you can spare the time, perhaps you and you wife would care to join me.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Well, I'll have to check with her, but it sounds like a wonderful idea. And after the play you must let us buy you dinner in return.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　See you tomorrow, Don.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　By-by.
　　
　　
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality, your excellent presentations and your patience. I'm afraid it has taken me a long time to decide on a European partner, but I am sure you will understand that it is a very improtant decision for Detmore Systems. I have looked at all the options, I have talked to my staff in Tokyo and we have decided on the Big Boss. Ten minutes ago Clive and I shook hands on a provisional agreement. There is still a lot of thing to do of course, but I am looking forward to a successful partership with your company. And I am sure we'll get to know each other very well over the next few months.
　　
　　The End of Unit 15

Unit16 Complaining about Products and Services
　　
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　I am sorry to have to say this, Clive, but we have got a problem.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Hasn't the consignment arrived yet? We send them off on...
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　No, Clive, you misunderstand me, the consignment arrived two days ago. Right on schedule. No, the problem is with the product itself.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　What is it?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Last night I had a phone call from one of my warehouse managers. He was very excited with the new product. He was certain that his son would love one. So he took one home, opened it up and switched it on, and heard this...
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Do you have any idea how many units are defective?
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　We spent the day checking the whole consignment. Unfortunately it looks like batch numbers 993 and 994 all have the same problem. Everything else seems fine. But it was a long job. My staff had to check every toy.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Kazo, I will get this sorted out immediately.
　　
　　Mr. Sakai:
　　Clive, it is essential that we have these on the shelves by the end of this week.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　I am sending Derek Jones over on the first flight. And I shall send Don to the suppiers to make sure it won't happen again
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　There are two hundred fault circuit boards. Our product for the Far Eastern launch is defective. This will damage our reputation in the market place and it's very embarrassing for us. I want to know what're you going to do to remedy the sitution.
　　
　　Mr. Clayton:
　　Mr. Bradley, we have tracked down the problem. We can guarantee that it won't happen again. There was a localized problem in quality control which we have isolated and rectified. We now have a new quality assurance programme.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　That's all very well. But you have failed to meet the terms of contract. I am afraid we have no option. We will have to terminate the contract and find a new supplier.
　　
　　Mr. Clayton:
　　Mr. Bradley, I understand your concern and recognise that it's a very unsatisfactory situation. But may I point out it was just two batches that were defective..
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　It may have been just two batches but we have two hundred defective productive products on the market with Bibury name on them. 
　　
　　Mr. Clayton:
　　Mr. Bradley, we appreciate that the situation has damaged your reputation. And we are very sorry. But we also have a good reputation and that reputation is built upon reliablity and good relationships with our customers. We supply many leading coompanies and we are very embarrassed by this incident. I must assure you that it won't happen again.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　How can I be certain that it won't happen again.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Hello, this is Bibury Systems. The fax machine that we hired from you has broken down. The paper keeps jamming. It hasn't work properly since you installed it. We would like someone to come and fix it now. Look, I spoke to someone three hours ago. The said engineer would come before lunchtime. But in the service agreement it says that you will send someone within twenty-four hours. We need it fixed today. Well, if you can't get it repaired today then we will have to cancel our rental agreement.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Hello!
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Welcome back. I hear that the American launch was a great success. 
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　I think we've cracked it. Orders of Big Boss are right on target. And I had a wonderful holiday. For a few weeks I managed to stop thinking about Big Boss. So how have things been here? Is this post mine?
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　No, this is yours. You haven't heard the news?
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　What's happened?
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　There is a problem on the circuitry on some of the units that went to Japan last week.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　What?
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Derek flew to Tokyo to look at the problem. 
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　So it's serious.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Yes, and Don's gone to the component supplier to find out how it happened. We think we have tracked the problem down to just two batches, but...
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　I don't believe this. Where's Clive?
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　He's in the meeting.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Jenny, I need to talk to him as soon as possible. I've negotiated sales of over 80,000 units to the States...
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　We have three options. We can re-negotiate with Southford Components or we can work with MAGL or Parkview.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　A crucial factor is how quickly they can deliver.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　MAGL certainly claim to be the fastest. But I'm worried that although they are fast they may not have the best quality control.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　And quality control was the problem with Southford Components.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Exactly. Although they have promised that their system is improved.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Look at these quotations. I don't think Parkview are the best option. They offer a very fast delivery time. They have a very high reputation and they are the nearest supplier to the assemble line. But there are very expensive compared with Southford.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Don, price can't be a factor at this stage.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I don't agree with you. I think we have to get the best service at the best price.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　I think we can re-negotiate a far better deal with soutford components. But we must move fast... Come in.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Clive, What on earth's going on?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Welcome back, Kate.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　I've just spent weeks selling Big Boss in the States and now I find out there's something wrong with it. Why didn't anyone tell me?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　We only discovered this yesterday. And we're fairly sure that none of defective circuits went to the States. Now, I spoke to New York ten minute ago. They're running a check. They're ringing back tomorrow. All the signs are that it is just those two batches in Japan.
　　
　　Mr. Smith:
　　I want to speak to Edward Green right away, please.
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　Do you have any appointment, sir?
　　
　　The end of Unit 16


Unit 17 Comparing products and prices
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　The Boss isn't doing as well as we had hoped. We didn't launch at the right time. I myself don't think the market was ready for us. Dealer Dan came later and cheaper... Maybe we should move downmarket in a couple of key territories.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Excuse me, can I interrupt?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Sure.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I've just had a call from Danny Mcneil at Eromart.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Oh really?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　He wants a meeting to discuss discounts. Althought he's talking about a substantial order, he wants better terms than I can authorise. Would you prefer to deal with him yourself?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　How larger a discount does he want?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　He didn't say. But I think it's higher than anything we've ever given before. He loved the product, though. I think he's ready to negotiate.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I think it's time that we work on this together. Do you agree?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Yes!
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Edward, are you coming down to the workshop? Derek wants to show us his latest idea.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Okay, I will join you later.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　No, I think Derek wants to talk to the whole team. Come on!
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Well, it's a terrific idea, but how much will it cost to develop?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Not as much as you think.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　It will be too expensive
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　No, not really. I have prepared a long, detailed, careful analysis of the development costs. See for yourself.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　It will never sell. Who's the market for this?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　It is more upmarket than Big Boss but it will still apeal to kids as well as excutives and office workers.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　But that's the problem Derek. There's no market focus. Do you remember the Easirite two years ago? We had a beautiful well-designed but expensive product. It was great. Parents and children could both use it. But could we sell it? No, it failed because we hadn't defined our market.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　But this is different. This is more fun than Easirite.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　The costings look okay, but it has too many moving parts.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　So does a car, but that seems to sell.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　That's not the point. The more moving parts you have the more likely something will go wrong.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I don't agree.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Let's just hold on a second and think about this. Derek you like the concept and think it will sell; Kate, you can't see a market for it.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　I can't see where it fits in our product range.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I'm inclined to agree with Kate. This is uch more expensive than anything else we market. 
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Although it's a wonderful idea, we just won't be able to sell it. You must see that yourself, Derek.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Well, not really...
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Edward, what do you think?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Can I just check something here Derek? Are you saying that there is a plastic thin enough and flexible enough to make this realistic?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Exactly.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　That's brilliant. On paper, I think it's the most remarkable thing I've seen.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Well, maybe Edward has something. Maybe we ought to have a closer look.
　　



　　Danny Mcneil:
　　I don't know what's happened to your boss. He knows I never start my meetings late. Do you want to wait here for Don or would you rather look around.(like to look around)
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　If it's all right with you, I 'd like to look around.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Good choice.
　　Of course, I have two or three meetings a day with sales people like you.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　It's very good of you to see me.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　I always talk to suppliers of myself: it's the best way of working. And I always prefer to bring them down here. They get a better idea of our operation. They must understand how we work. Our success is based upon a certain formula.
　　whereas most supermarkets target individual territories, our products are pan-European. We always buy in the products with the best sales performance, products with a proven track record. We look for the biggest discounts and we usually get them.
　　Ncneil.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Danny, it's Don Bradley here.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Good morning, Don. I thought I was meeting you here.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I am sorry Danny. That was the plan, but I am going to be late. This meeting is taking long than expected.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Oh, when can you be here?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I will be there as soon as I can. Is Edward with you?
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Yes.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Could you start the meeting without me? Edward knows the situation. Oh, and can I have a quick word with him?
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　I'll pass the phone to him.
　　Okay, It's for you. It's Don Bradley. He 's get a problem.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Oh, thanks.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Would you like a word in private?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　If you don't mind.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Sorry, Edward. I am stuck in a meeting here. You'll have to deal with Mcneil by yourself.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Oh.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Yes, he stepped away for a few minutes. Do you really want me to negotiate? Wouldn't you rather postpone the meeting?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　How do you feel about?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I'm happy to go ahead, I think.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　You don't sound sure.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I'm not.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　We've talked about this negotiation. You know the game plan. Do you best. I'll be there as soon as I can.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Okay Don. I'll do what I can. See you later.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Okay?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Yes, thanks.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　So Don can't make it. Oh well, right, what was I saying? Discounts.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　We're certainly happy to talk about possible discounts.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　You see this?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Yes.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　How many of these do you think we've sold in Europe in the past month?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　1,800---2,000
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　We sell more than that weekly.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　How much do you sell it for?
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　This retails in France for 130 FF. We sell it much cheaper:90 FF.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　That's very impressive.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　I work on higher volumes and I have to move products faster than any other retailer. And that means I operate on smaller margins. And I repeat, I expect the largest discounts in the indstry. But over there, there is a product that failed. We made a mistake with this one. Of course, I didn't select this one myself. Right you've seen how our operation works. You know what I'm after. Let's get down to business. Would you prefer to talk here or in my office?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　The office is fine.
　　
　　The End of the Unit 17

Unit 18 Negotiating prices
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Before we begin, are you sure that you are in a position to conduct this negotiation.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Yes, I have the authority to negotiate with you.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Right, let's get down to business.
　　
　　Eward Green:
　　Which of our product lines are you particularly interested in Mr. McNeil?
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　I could be interested in these ones that I have outlined here. But I want to hear what you say about discounts.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Let's talk specifically about Big Boss.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Let's be clear about one thing. I hope you realize that we must have a much larege discount than what's on table now.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I think the discount problem can be resolved but you need to be more precise about numbers.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Fair enough. What kind of discount are you offering on ten thousand units?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　On ten thousand units, Mr. Mcneil, I can offer a discount of 30 percent. But I can offer more...
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Thirty percenty!
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Just let me finish, 30 percent, but with a guarantee of delivery within 2 months.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Delivery must be within 2 months or I'm not interested. I'm offer you the chance to make a very large sale and you are turning it down, because we're
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Can I just come in Mr. Mcneil? I haven't turned anything down. I haven't said ''no''. I am just saying that on 10 thousand units our discount terms are 30 percent.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　But...
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Please let me finish. Now if you commit to buy 20 thousand units, then I can concider a larger discount
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　How much larger?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　If you commit to twenty thousand units then I can offer a thirty-five percent discount.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Thirty, thirty-five precent. I'm getting tired of this. You are playing games. I'm looking for a large discount, and I hope that you're going to offer me one.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　If you want a big discount then you must make the offer a big one. Let's talk about unit price rather than discount. Our standard unit price to the wholesaler is 23.5. 
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　And I am not interested in 23.5.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Yes, I know that Mr. Mcneil.
　　If you buy 45 thousand units then I can offer you a unit price of 19.5. What will your mark-up be on the Boss, 3, 3.5, 4 ?
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　About that.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　With those figures you're going to be very competitive.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　19.5 unit price.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　If you buy 40 thousand units. That represents a discounts of ...
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　I have a calculator too. I can see what discount is. Offer me a unit price of 19.5 on 25 thousand units and we can do business.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I can't do that. I am sorry.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Let's break for a few minutes. I've got a few things I have to see to. I will be a couple of minutes. Would you like a cup of coffee?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Yes, please.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Help yourself to the phone if you want to make a call.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Thanks.
　　
　　Don Bradley.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Hi, Don. How's the meeting?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　It's just finished. I'm on my way over. How's your meeting?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　He's definitely interested. We're having a break.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　What's the situation?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　It's becoming difficult. We're stuck on the size of the order for Big Boss. He wants a unit price of 19.5 on an order of 25 thousand.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　That sounds good to me.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I think we can push him further.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Do you think so?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I think so. I hope so.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Be careful. He's a clever man. I've dealt with Mcneil before. When he starts banging on the table, that's as far as you can go with him.
　　Good Luck!
　　
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Thanks. So let's clarify the position so far. As far as Big Boss is concerned we have agreed on a unit price of 20 for 30,000, and I can't go below that price for an order of this size. Now look at terms of payment.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　ninety days.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I sorry Mr. Mcnei, but that's completely unacceptable. Our standard policy on discounts of over thirty percent is payment within thirty days of delivery.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　This is not a standard situation. I am making a very large order...
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Can I just come in here, Mr. Mcneil? I know you are making a large order but you are also getting in an excellent product at very large discount.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　I can't believe that this is your final offer.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　If you order 35,000 then I authorise payment in 90 days.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　We have already decided on quantity. This is my last offfer: 30,000 at 60 days payment. Take it or leave it.

　　Edward Green:
　　I think that offer will be acceptable. So all we have to do now is finalise the delivery arrangements.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Well, let's discuss the details tomorrow.
　　Come in. Don, how are you?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Hello, Danny, Edward. I'm sorry, I am late.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　You are late. I'd rather do business with you than with this young man. What have you been feeding him?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Oh, we don't feed him. We like to keep our staff hungry.
　　
　　The End of Unit 18



Unit 19 Negotiating Delivery
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I'd like you to look at those figures. As you can see, the maximum retail price for must be 60. That means, that to keep our margins, our production costs must be no more than 14 per unit.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I'd rather have a retail price of 75. I don't believe that the Mark two can be produced for less than 18 per unit.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　That retail price is not a realistic option, Derek. We've done the research.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　But it's not just a toy. This is a genuine breakthrough .
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Derek...
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Let me finish. This is a genuine breakthrough and the market will be preared to pay a premium price for something that is so advanced.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Derek, let me..
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Just a minute. There is nothing like this on the market. We have to take a chance with it.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Derek, I don't like arguing with you, but I have to agree with Don. I am sorry. We can't take the risk. I say we retail at 60 and produce at 14.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　No manufacturer will be able to produce the Mark 2 for 14 per unit and maintain the quality.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　I would rather not to decide anything now.
　　
　　derek Jones:
　　I would like to show it to Hzelford Systems. They might be able to produce it for 15 or 16.
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Jenny, could you do something about this fax machine? Phone the company, cancel the rental agreement and get the best deal you can from another firm. I'm sick of this.
　　
　　Jenny ross:
　　Hello,this is Jenny Ross of Bibury systmes. No, I am sorry. I would rather just cancel the agreement.
　　No, we did ask you to send someone yesterday and it still isn't working properly. I am sorry , but I have to say no. Yes, if you could send someone to collect it tomorrow morning, please.
　　
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　Now let's turn to the Big Boss. When as soon as you can deliver?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　You can have the first five thousand units before the end of the month.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　I want ten thousand by the end of the month.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Well, Mr. Mcneil, that will be difficult, but as you have been so understanding over the question of price, I think we can arrange that.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　What about the balance of the order?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　We can deliver that in there consignments over the following three months.
　　
　　Danny Mcneil:
　　I had rather have everything delivered by the end of the May.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I can't promise to do that, but I shall do my best.
　　
　　
　　Ms Wong:
　　First of all, let me welcome all the representatives of Bibury Systems. I'd like to say that we at Hazelford Systems are delighted that you are considering us as a future supplier. Perhaps I could begin by checking that everyone has a copy of the agenda? 
　　And I like to add one extra item, if I may? Could we discuss the question of exchange procedures after item four, which looks at general payment conditions? So let's make a start.
　　Mr. Jones, would you like to outline the position on the first item on the ageda: technological specifications?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Thank you. I think that we need to consider a couple of options when we look at this question...
　　
　　
　　
　　Fax REP:
　　so that's fine. You can sign the contract When we deliver the machine.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　How soon can we expect delivery?
　　
　　Fax REP:
　　Well, would next Tuesday be convenient?
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　No, we really need it today.
　　
　　Fax REP:
　　I'm afraid that's just not possible.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Well, what is the earliest you can deliver?
　　
　　Fax REP:
　　We can't do it before Friday afternoon.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Well, I'm afraid we really need the machine by tomorrow at the latest, or I am going to have to look elsewhere.
　　
　　Fax REP:
　　Okay, I'll see what I can do.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　I'm sorry but that just isn't good enough. I must have the guarantee of delivery by tomorrow.
　　
　　Fax ERP:
　　I'll need to speak to my boss. Can I call you back in ten minutes?
　　
　　
　　Ms Wong:
　　I'm sorry This is a very difficult situation. I understand your problem, but you must see our position. We think this is a very exciting project, but because we cannot find a compromise I am afraid we can go no further.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　We cannot go higher than 14 for 30,000 units. that is our final offer.
　　
　　Ms Wong:
　　But you must realise that at this price our margin is unacceptable. So I think we have covered all the items on today's agenda. I am sorry that we have reached no solution on the final item which is the Mark 2 project.
　　Could I suggest that we adjourn for today and meet tomorrow morning at ten o'clock?
　　
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Is Clive back yet?
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　He phoned about twenty minutes ago. Said he was on his way. He didn't sound very happy.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　Oh, dear. I wanted to ask him about taking couple of days off.
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　Suggest that you wait. I don't think that... Oh, Mr. Harris there is a message from...
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Geraldine, I'm in a meeting with Derek. Hold all my calls.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　I see what you mean!
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　I've never seen Derek look so angry. What's going on?
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　I don't know? Have they had an argument?
　　
　　Kate Mckenna:
　　Well, that was an interesting journey! Twenty minutes of total silence.
　　
　　Jenny Ross:
　　What's going on?
　　
　　kate Mckenna:
　　I think the word to describe the situation is 'deadlock'.
　　
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Derek, you are being unreasonable. 
　　
　　derek Jones:
　　Me? Why won't you move on fourteen?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Derek, we have been through this. We have agreed our negotiating position. I have never agreed to this position. We aren't offering any flexibility. They have to protect their margins.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Then we can't do the project.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　That's your decision, is it?
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Derek, I have no choice.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I'm sorry Clive. I can't accept that.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　What are you saying?
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I'm giving in my resignation.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　That's ridiculous. You're tired. Sleep on it and we'll talk in the morning.
　　
　　
　　
　　The End of Unit 19
　　Unit 20 Concluding a Deal
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　I have been with Bibury System for 12 years. I have given the 
　　
　　company 100 for sent commentment. I feel very disappointed 
　　
　　that you aren unable to support me on this project. I know 
　　
　　that the Mark Two will work, and it will sell. I attend to 
　　
　　start a look for a company that values new ideas.
　　
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　Derek, There must be a way around this. I know how you feel, and I do value you contribution. To prove it I am going to increase your research budget.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　That's not the point, Clive.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Clive Harris, yes, put it through. Sally, Good morning. Yes, 
　　
　　he is. It's Sally Wong. She want to talk to you.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Edward, I have looked through the draft contract with Mark. I've seen your covered packaging, insurement, late delivery penalties. And you did well to make it more flexible over terms of payments. Well done. Now we can get the contract finalised. 
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Before I go, can we have a chat?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Sure, what about?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Don I have been with Bibury System now, and I like to talk about my future.
　　
　　
　　MS Wong:
　　I am terribly sorry to ask you come here earlier, but I had purpose that can benifit both of us. Could I suggest we look these decisions again? Particilly I want you to look in  the interface between the realsl and Sigana. I belive we can　make the process simple.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　No, I have been through these many times.
　　
　　Ms Wong:
　　I am sorry. If you could just by me with second. I spend all 
　　
　　last night worrying about this. I believe the conclusion of 
　　
　　yesterday's meeting was very unforchinit. I want to find a 
　　
　　way forward , and I think I have. The Sigana doesnot need to 
　　
　　be powered from the same source, that means they can be 
　　
　　produced cerpertly. 
　　
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　No, no, no... You are right. This is brilliant.
　　
　　Ms Wong:
　　It's very simple.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Is there any problem? Are you unhappy here?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Yes, but I have to know what place you have for me? I feel I 
　　
　　have made good progress here over the last six month. What do 
　　
　　you think?
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I agree. We are very happy with what we have done. Of course, 
　　
　　you did make a fill mistakes. Especially Early you are. But 
　　
　　Gengeraly I see what's in part of the team. And I am sure 
　　
　　Kate goes alone with that.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　That's good to hear, thank you. I feel I have learned a lot 
　　
　　here in the last months. Aberjestly, six months I couldn't 
　　
　　negotiate a large deal with Erel Mart, but now I can.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Let's be opened Edward. Are you talking about salary?
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　It's not just a question of money, Don. I want to look the 
　　
　　whole package, it sale performance relit boners, a company 
　　
　　charge card, a expensive count, a car and an more responsible 
　　
　　position.
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I think we should sit down, don't you?
　　
　　
　　
　　Mr Wong:
　　I am very happy that we have been able to over con 
　　
　　difficulties. I think our negotiation have been very 
　　
　　sucessful, and as a without we are position to move for this 
　　
　　project.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　I would like to thank Saily Wong for her understanding 
　　
　　contribution to this project.
　　
　　Derek Jones:
　　Here, here.
　　
　　Clive Harris:
　　She has worked very hard to find solution to what send any 
　　
　　possible problem.
　　
　　Ms Wong:
　　Thank you. I think The Mark Two is very excited concept. 
　　
　　Perhaps we should spend some time somrising and clarify what 
　　
　　we have agreed.
　　
　　
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　Edward, If you are insisting on a car, then I can't offer you 
　　
　　such a large salary increase. And we have to find some 
　　
　　compromise on the beforement relidi bouniss.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　I think I am mosy salary.
　　
　　
　　Don Bradley:
　　I am prefered to offer you a larger bonus. But if you accept 
　　
　　that, then you have to accept the smaller salary increase.
　　
　　Edward Green:
　　Could you be more prcise?

　　Don Bradley:
　　If you accept a 15 percent increase salary, then I can add another 5 percent on the bonus next year, if you make you target.

　　Edward Green:
　　Okay, if you make 17 percent salary increase, I think we can make agreement.

　　Don Bradley:
　　Okay.

　　Clive Harris:
　　Sally, We very much appreciate your effects to make this product possible. I have a small toy of our gratitude to which I would like you to have.

　　Ms Wong:
　　This is very kind of you.

　　Edward Green:
　　We just leaves the matter of a car?

　　Don Breadley:
　　But Edward, I said the salary increase with condicion you make in a selection on a car.

　　Edward Green:
　　I except a smaller car.

　　Don Bradley:
　　All right. Let's go through this point once more. Clive is going to kill me. Where's do you learn negotiating, Edward?

　　Edward Green:
　　You told me everything I know, Don.

　　Jenny Ross:
　　Good night, Geraldine.
　　
　　Geraldine:
　　Good night.
